This mod adds a Diamond apple. A Diamond apple is incredibly powerful but also extremely hard to craft in moderate to large quantities, as the recipe requires eight diamonds per apple!

I would hope that this gives mining after mending a purpose again.

## Effects
A Diamond apple gives everything an Enchanted golden apple does, and then some. Which probably makes it very unbalanced, but that's what updates are for! 

All effects last for five minutes.

Currently a diamond apple provides:
- Absorption 10
- Regeneration 5
- Resistance 4
- Fire Resistance 
- Strength 3
- Water Breathing
- Speed 2
